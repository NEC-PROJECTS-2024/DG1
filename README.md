### INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels due to inadequate insulin production or insulin resistance. It is categorized into three main types: IDDM (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus), NIDDM (Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus), and Type 3 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is mainly affecting children under 30 and involves increased thirst, elevated blood sugar, and frequent urination. Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by insulin resistance and is more prevalent in adults who do not rely on insulin. Type 3 diabetes is specific to pregnant women and leads to elevated blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Diagnosing diabetes requires a comprehensive evaluation, including laboratory and medical tests. An efficient prediction system based on these variables is crucial for early diagnosis and management. This study aims to combine various machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction model for early diabetes diagnosis and analyze its predictive capacity.
